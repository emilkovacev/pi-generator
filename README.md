# Pi Generator

In time for Ï€ day 2021, here are 3 unique methods of generating pi! 
Feel free to use them at your leisure or send a few pull requests to add more.

*Inspired by Matt Parker from Stand-up Maths*

## Generating Methods
* infinite series generator: two different infinite series to approximate pi that converge at different rates
* spigot: a very efficient algorithm used to calculate hex digits of pi
* statistics generator: slightly inneficient method of using the probability of drawing a pair of cofactors on a specificly sized pair of die to extrapulate the number 6/(pi^2)

## Plots
* the statistics plot will plot the accuacy of the statistical generation of pi averaged over a number of computations
